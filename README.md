# redis-clone
This is a fork of the ["Build your own redis" course](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/redis/overview) on CodeCrafters.

I've been interested in starting a redis clone type of project for a while, so when I found the course I decided to go for it. I don't really want to pay for the CodeCrafters membership though, since I was only using their service for the test cases thus far. I figure I'll continue working on the problems in the course, but just host the code here.
